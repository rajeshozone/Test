## The Sandbox


### Introduction

This Sandbox has been created by [Ozone](https://ozoneapi.com) to enable developers to build and test open banking enabled applications.

It is based on the latest version 3.1.8 of the [UK open banking standard](https://standards.openbanking.org.uk/) which defines how regulated Third Party Providers (TPPs) can access APIs which enable Account Information Services (AIS), Payment Initiation Services (PIS), Confirmation of Funds (CBPII) and Variable Recurring Payments (VRPs) for personal and business customer accounts.

This sandbox includes a test bank (a simulation of an Account Servicing Payment Service Provider or ASPSP), which provides access to these APIs, containing test bank accounts with synthetic transaction datasets.

Specifically, this sandbox will enable developers to build applications
